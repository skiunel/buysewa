##  How to Use

### Demo eSewa Payment

1. **Add items to cart**
2. **Go to checkout**
3. **Select "eSewa" payment method**
4. **Click "Pay"**
5. **You'll be redirected to demo payment page**

**No eSewa credentials needed!** The demo API simulates the entire flow.

### AI Chatbot

1. **Look for the chat icon** in bottom-right corner
2. **Click to open** the chatbot
3. **Ask questions** like:
   - "How do I place an order?"
   - "How does the review system work?"
   - "What payment methods do you accept?"

### Blockchain System

The blockchain system is **fully integrated**:

2. **SDC Registration** → Registered on blockchain (or simulated)
3. **Review Submission** → Stored on blockchain with IPFS hash
4. **Transaction Hashes** → Stored in database and displayed
